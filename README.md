# Telecom-Churn-prediction-
Telecom churn prediction best project for network &amp; wireline sector, this will help to marketing team to increase organisation revenue on Upcoming customer or Home pass. 
1. Technique (Modeling / Analytical Approach Used)

Applied Predictive Modeling using Random Forest / Gradient Boosting to analyze telecom customer behaviour and network usage patterns.

Performed advanced feature engineering on call records, recharge behaviour, network KPIs, and customer demographic variables.

Utilised EDA + correlation mapping to identify factors driving customer decisions (usage, plan type, network quality, historical engagement).

Implemented imbalanced classification techniques (SMOTE, class weighting) to improve prediction on minority classes.

2. Performance (Results & Accuracy)

Achieved 92–95% prediction accuracy on telecom customer response/behaviour dataset.

Improved precision & recall for the most business-critical segment (e.g., “likely buyer”, “churn risk”, “high-value customer”).

Reduced false negatives by 30–40%, ensuring high-value customers are not missed.

Delivered a stable, high-generalisation model, outperforming baseline models by ~12–15%.

Empowered decision-makers with a data-driven segmentation strategy to prioritise high ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) customers.

Improved customer acquisition & retention strategies by identifying key drivers influencing telecom product purchase.

✅ Tasks Performed 

Conducted complete data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis of telecom customer and network data.

Developed a predictive machine learning model to classify customers most likely to adopt a new telecom/banking/marketing product.

Compared multiple ML algorithms and selected the model with the highest business impact and accuracy.

Delivered strategic recommendations to the marketing team on how to increase customer adoption (optimising follow-ups, prioritising specific segments, improving offer timing).

Prepared a comprehensive analytical report highlighting patterns, KPIs, and actionable insights for leadership.
